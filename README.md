### start to develop

1.- First, we download the project:
```
    git clone url  (select master branch)
```
2.- Second, perform a package update in your work environment.
```
    npm install   (we will update the npm libraries, in our team.)
 ```
3.- Third step, you go to the develop branch.
```
    git checkout develop-pcp
    (You can check which branch you are in, with the command: 
    "git branch", the list of branches will be displayed and the one in which you are located appears with:*current_branch)
```
4.- Fourth step, we create our working branch, from the "develop-pcp" branch, with the command:
```
    git checkout -b  name_branch   
    (branch name is recommended: feature/name_feature_or_function)
    ***Never use any other branch than develop to create the working branches***
```
5.- Fifth step, upload your branch and start working.
```
    git push --set-upstream origin name_branch
```
